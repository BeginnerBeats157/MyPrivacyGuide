# Recommendations (Endorsement) Guide
(⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀)
This is my list of privacy tools (software) that will help you remain private online. Some of them are taken from their official repositories[^1], while others are chosen and reviewed, by me. There is actually _<ins>no silver bullet</ins>_ in regards to privacy, security, or anonymity, but it is believed that _<ins>these tools (software) will make tracking you online a (very) difficult task</ins>_.

> [!NOTE]
> Most of the contents are either written by me or taken from a source. Remember that this is solely based on the official Privacy Raccoon website, and most of the time making another .md file regarding https://github.com/pluja/awesome-privacy is coming soon and might take some time to write it all down and do some corrections. Research is on-going and will need a specific review, depending on my experience or during my review or research. Some are removed (either entirely or a specific reason), while some are added into the mix, or changed. (Not this page, but for another page.)
