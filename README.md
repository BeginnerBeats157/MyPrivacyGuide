# Welcome to "MyPrivacyGuide" dear viewer!

Since you came to this repository, then welcome. In this repository, feel free to book mark this page and get yourself educate for **once and for all**. This is an inspiration of the original website named "Privacy Raccoon" and it's supposed to be a continuation of The Privacy Raccoon and "an_g6" website. And by all means necessary, it licensed under the CC0 1.0 (Going to change the license), however I am by no means responsible for any copyright violations but it is an act of contribution as a way to create a continuation of a now defunct website.

There is no need for a donation as I do not think I will need it yet. Not as a Administrative Needs.

Report any mistakes, errors, grammar issues, and _other_ by creating an issue or by going to our Discord server: (not ready yet)
If you have something to add, create a issue or by going to our discord.
If you want to contribute to this github page then contact me via Eletronic Mail or via Session.


Everything is Subject to change.
