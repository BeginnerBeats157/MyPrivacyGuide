# The "MyPrivacyGuide" Wikipedia

Welcome to this website, a full on wikipedia regarding all the information about privacy, digital and physical privacy, human error changes, endorsements or recommendations, and overall storing or archiving certain information, from other wikis in general. Also serving as a news place. This project is inspired by: The Raccoon Privacy, The EFF, The PrivacyGuides (But better), PrivacyGuides.io (also better), and Pluja's "Awsome Privacy".
